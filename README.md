A cute little moon rabbit is just too happy to eat his rice cakes! BOING, oh no
there he goes. Our little moon rabbit has jumped into space! Help him land on
the moon safely and not crash land.

### About this game

The rabbit will be bouncing around the screen off the edges and off the platform
the player controls.
